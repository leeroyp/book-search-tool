How long did you spend on the coding assignment ?
    I spent a total of four hours and 23 mins on this coding assingment 

Q. what would you add to your solution if you had more time ?
A. If I had more time, i would have like to implement pagination to the project that way we can render a max of 10 results per page which will also help the app run faster 

Q. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

A. Lately I have been using a new react library called react query which is used for fetching, caching data without and use of global states. I find this libary to be very powerful and with endless opportuinities. 

Q. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Perfomance issues in production can be tracked down through consistancy in testing. We can also used Logs to measure the system's perfomance . I often use the network tab under my dev tool, This tool always helps me track down were my network might be taking too long to log data as result we maybe able to troubleshoot the specific component that is causing any issues.

Q. How would you improve the API that you just used?
A. After working with this API for this project, the first thing i would do is adding caching for the api, for this application,  this would reduce the nummber of calls  for the books already cached making the API even faster. I would also add pagination to larger payloads, this will limit the number of results fetched  which in return making our calls faster.This significantly reduced the payload size for customers with a long history of orders
 
Q.Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON
A.
